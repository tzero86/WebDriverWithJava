# Webdriver with Java Course

This repo contains my solutions for each chapter of the Webdriver with Java Course from Test Automation University.

These chapters cover a lot of what's commonly used during automated tests, and it is a good reference on how to deal with
different web elements, cookies, alerts, file uploads and much more. If you find this useful feel free to clone the
repository and use it as the starting point for your test automation solution.

## Updates

I will try to continue adding some examples to this repository in case I have to deal with a situation or web element that 
is not already covered here.

You can find me as [@tzero86](https://twitter.com/Tzero86) on Twitter if you want to reach out with questions.

Thanks!
